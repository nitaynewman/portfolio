      In the Idf I learned Web Development and after I got proficient in python for backend Development and html, css, JavaScript for frontend Development i started experimenting with React and with time became proficient in that as well. <br />
      This gave me a lot of experience learning code and working with multiple technologies such as SQL, Elasticsearch, mongoDB, Openshift - doker and more. <br />
      After getting that experience I decided to become a profesional at python development, so I learned by making a lot of projects, in this portfolio project I decided to show you my faveret and or best projects. <br /> enjoyüëç <br />
